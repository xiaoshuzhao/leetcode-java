###  12. 整数转罗马数字

Integer to Roman

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

```
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
```

将特殊的罗马数字与整数用index一一对应

从最高位开始添加罗马数字的符号，并减去对应的值来更新原来的值

```java
class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        // 本题有限制 1 <= num <= 3999 ，所以数字最高的是3999，罗马数组对应最高只需要"M"
        // 在这个区间范围，有特殊变化的就是以下的值
        // 从最高的进位依次相加并且减去：比如124，先加100，然后加2个10，再加4即可
        int[] nums = {1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1};
        String[] roman = {"M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"};
        int index = 0;

        // index 从0开始不可能到12，一共可选的符号就只有13个
        while (index < 13) {
            while (num >= nums[index]) {
                res.append(roman[index]);
                num -= nums[index];
            }
            index++;
        }
        return res.toString();
    }
}
```
